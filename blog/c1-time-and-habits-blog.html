            <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
            <p>
              Simplicity in my process is of the utmost importance to me, as a generally chaotic person. So I'm trying the Pomodoro technique, as it's the most tangible, easily-accessible technique on the list.
            </p>
            <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
            <p>
              Meditation also interests me. I'm concerned about my attention span - perhaps I've bought into the cultural notion that devices/the internet/insert given technology here... have ruined people's ability to focus, but in any case I want to see if meditation can improve my own. I also am interested in quieting my busy mind of unnecessary thought, so to speak, which would surely contribute to improved focus. In my other professional life, I've found intense focus to be crucial: I want to lock in with a bass player's quarter note, and contribute only the accompaniment which is necessary to support a soloist and 'fly' with them.
              In addition, the notion of confidence being displayed ability even only to onesself is pretty revelatory. That's what I'm here to build.
            </p>
            <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
            <p>
              Pomodoro seems pretty effective!
            </p>
            <h4>Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
            <p>
              All of those I mentioned in question two - meditation, confidence as ability demonstrated, as well as using Pomodoro and similar techniques to introduce time constraints and habit building.
