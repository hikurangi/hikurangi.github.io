          <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
          <p>I've only just read these articles, so I have little experience so far. However...</p>
          <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
          <p>All of it, really. I find meditation for one, to be very interesting. I'm concerned about my attention span - perhaps I've bought into the cultural notion that devices/the internet/insert given technology here... have ruined people's ability to focus, but in any case I want to see if meditation can improve my own. I also am interested in quieting my busy mind of unnecessary thought, so to speak, which would surely contribute to improved focus. In my other professional life, I've found intense focus to be crucial: I want to lock in with a bass player's quarter note, and contribute only the accompaniment which is necessary to support a soloist and 'fly' with them.
          In addition, the notion of confidence being displayed ability even only to onesself is pretty revelatory. Love it, and will absolutely try it. The Pomodoro technique is a simple and effective concept which I'll definitely try, despite the slightly over-marketed appearance of the system. The idea of a discrete or artificially limited unit of time set to accomplish something resonates with me. Building motivation from behaviours, and building those behaviours from habits which start very small, is another interesting strategy.</p>
          <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
          <p>See my answer to question one!</p>
          <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
          <p>All of those I mentioned in question two - meditation, confidence as ability demonstrated, introducing time constraints and habit building.</p>
