            <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
            <p>
              Grid-based design with specific reference to the material we're covering in the course, is a method of creating a website, using HTML and CSS which simplifies and makes-logical the creation of webpage layouts, and easily facilitates responsiveness in web design. It uses a combination of row and column elements, styled with specific sizes or ratios to create grid layouts, from where it no doubt derives its name.
            </p>
            <h4> What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>
            <p>
              Responsive webpages can in theory be viewed on a wider variety of devices and screen sizes/orientations, adapting as that variety grows. They're the future of the web
            </p>
            <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>
            <p>
              Semantic structure in HTML refers to the embedded meaning or purpose of elements, as understood by a machine. A computer can immediately understand that h1 headings are more imporant that h6 headings. In contrast, a human can infer the significance of a piece of text simply by its position on the screen, or its size, or weight. We can immediately interpret a large-styled 'p' as having the same significance as an equally large 'h1' when we're viewing a page through our browser, where our computers may not. Pete J. directed me to a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">helpful article</a> which covers HTML5 semantic elements.
