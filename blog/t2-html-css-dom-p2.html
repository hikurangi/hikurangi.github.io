          <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
          <p>Grid-based design with specific reference to the material we're covering in the course, is a method of creating a website, using HTML and CSS which simplifies and makes-logical the creation of webpage layouts, and easily facilitates responsiveness in web design. It uses a combination of row and column elements, styled with specific sizes or ratios to create grid layouts, from where it no doubt derives its name. </p>
          <h2> What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
          <p>Responsive webpages can in theory be viewed on a wider variety of devices and screen sizes/orientations. They're the future of the web!</p>
          <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
          <p>Semantic structure in HTML refers to the hierarchy of elements - headings, for example - as opposed to large text. The h1, h2, h3, carry meaning and denote the importance of each category, so regardless of how they're styled and sized, their underlying meaning in the hierarchy of a webpage remains. The tags h, p, ul, and so on carry meaning which is immediately understood by machines, where humans are sophisticated enough to understand the implied meaning and significance of text displayed on the page from its content, as well as its styling, size and layout. Machines are not quite sophisticated enough to consistently understand the implied meaning and purpose of page items through their size, styling, layout and sometimes even content alone.</p>
