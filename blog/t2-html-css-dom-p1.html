          <h4>Feature Wishlist</h4>
          <p><em>I'm trying to keep this very simple. I really like minimal websites.</em></p> 
          <ul>
            <li>A responsive background image which rescales proportionally to cover the whole width of the screen, but is short and doesn't cover a huge amount of vertical space.</li>
            <li>A centred, minimal, text-only menu above the image, with hover links.</li>
            <li>A simple column of text in the centre, below the image where relevant.</li>
            <li>CSS3 Gradients - probably not a moving one, but I like the impact of <a href="http://m-goldstein.com/">this one</a> though I can happily leave the animation out for now.</li>
            <li>A drop-down menu for blogs as they accumulate.</li>
            <li>The 12-column reflexive CSS design from the Udacity lesson - page heading and navbar at the top, all body content inside a central column below.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4>
          <p>Perhaps it's a little morbid, but HTML is essentially the bones and the flesh of a website's 'body'; it provides the content and that alone. CSS describes the way that content looks and expresses itself in web browsers, it's complexion, clothing choice, hair and eye colour, and the way the person walks. CSS shapes the page into what we see. The DOM is (in my still-forming understanding) where this analogy breaks down. It's like the collected, manipulable result of HTML and CSS (and potentially other scripts) working together. It also operates a little like language would in the previous example - it llows developers to manipulate HTML code with things like Javascript - to shape the behaviour of a person using external stimuli.</p>
          <h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
          <p>Boxifying design refers to the fact that all the elements we see on a webpage are generally contained within boxes - rectangular shapes! Any exceptions to this rule (again, in my limited understanding) are either trickery, using boxes, or DOM manipulations of HTML/injections of other languages and APIs.</p>
          <h4>What is the box model?</h4>
          <p>The CSS box model is a way to manipulate the rectangular elements in HTML, using attributes like 'margin', 'border', 'padding' and 'content'. While these have specific meanings in the context of CSS, you can imagine, generally speaking, which aspects of an HTML element these will affect.</p>
