            <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
            <p>Chade-Meng Tan states that emotional intelligence allow us to create an environment in which our happiness, "<em>a deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind...</em>" (Matthieu Ricard), can exist and persist. He talks about returning to a state of happiness as the basic point of equilibrium, with resilience, optimism and kindness as its by-products (though it seems to me that optimism is also a source of happiness as a state of equilibrium).
            I found it interesting to note that the body often acts as an early-warning detector for emotion. Part of the process of developing emotional intelligence according to this book, is being aware of these physical indicators. I also have read before that simply naming emotions as they become present, allows us to take control of them, so reading that again here reinforces the technique's importance for me.</p>
            <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
            <p>I did the 'Easy Way' and certainly got a sense of the world slowing down, and maybe becoming a little more accessible. I look forward to trying this on a more regular basis, and experimenting with environments and silence.</p>
