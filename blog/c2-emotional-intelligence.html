          <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
          <p>... states that emotional intelligence allow us to create an environment in which our happiness "<em>a deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind...</em>" (Matthieu Ricard) can exist and persist. He talks about returning to a state of happiness as the basic point of equilibrium, with resilience, optimism and kindness as its by-products, though it seems to me that optimism is also a source of happiness as a state of equilibrium.... quotes Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer who define Emotional Intelligence as:</p>
          <p<em>The ability to monitor one's own and emotions, to discriminate among them and use this information to guide one's thinking and actions."</em></p>
          <p>s a general observation I find the detached, scientific approach to a concept and topic which is often otherwise diffuse and vague, interesting. Being able to 'seize the reins' at will is appealing.</p>
          <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
          <p>I did the 'Easy Way' and certainly got a sense of the world slowing down, and maybe becoming a little more accessible. I look forward to trying this on a more regular basis, and experimenting with environments and silence.</p>
