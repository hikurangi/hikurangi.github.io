            <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
            <p>
              The learning curve is much steeper. The syntax seems a little looser - JavaScript doesn't mind if you leave in(or out) a few spaces, it isn't overzealously concerned about the presence of the odd extra semicolon. That seeming looseness actually makes it more perplexing for me at this stage.
              In terms of its function, JavaScript provides websites with the ability to be much more interactive and dynamic than HTML or CSS can allow for. It can take data input, reinterpret it, and return it by manipulating the DOM. It's the first 'real' programming language we've dealt with in this course.
            </p>
            <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h4>
            <p>
              Before I use the analogy, I'd best give a little backstory. There are two main control flow statements which involve loops which we've dealt with before: <code>for</code> and <code>while</code>. I'll give the analogy with reference to each, one by one.<br><br>
              <code>for</code>
              is a statement which comes with a set of conditions which repeat while certain conditions are in place. In pseudocode:<br>
              <code>for (<em>intial condition</em>, <em>termination condition</em>, <em>increment</em>) { and in here goes an instruction to perform at each increment between the <em>initial condition</em> and the <em>termination condition</em>}.</code><br>
              In the language of tooth-brushing:<br>
              <code>for (<em>filthy teeth</em>, <em>clean teeth</em>, <em>one scrub of the toothbrush</em>) {
              <em>keep cleaning</em>;
              };</code><br>
              Meaning: Starting from a point of having filthy teeth, we check to see if our teeth are clean. If they are not, one scrub/iteration at a time, we keep cleaning, and the process repeats until our teeth are clean.<br><br>
              <code>while</code>
              is similar, but rather than have the iteration on-board, it carries a single condition which is true for the loop to operate, but must be made false by an external factor (variable!) rather than a local condition as in the <code>for</code> example.
            </p>
            <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h4>
            <p>
                An <em>array</em> is a set of data stored in sequence, whose data can be accessed merely by knowing which number in the sequence corresponds to the target data, so we can access the 'n'th item in an array simply by addressing it in the form <code>myArray[n-1]</code> - we subtract '1' from 'n' because arrays are indexed from zero, not one as we normally count. Objects store data in key/value pairs rather than a set sequence, so we can access a value in an object by addressing it in the following form: <code>myObject[myKey]</code>.
            </p>
            <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h4>
            <p>
              Functions allow us to encapsulate large processes in single variables, but also feed external parameters into those variables (functions) so they can be used in internal calculations. Declaring a function once, then calling it later using what amounts to a single variable saves us from repeating large chunks of code every time we want to run the same process or calculation.
