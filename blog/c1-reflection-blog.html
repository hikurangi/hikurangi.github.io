          <h2>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h2>
          <p>It has an interesting culture which I haven't been exposed to before, with its own jargon, and a very particular ethic. Holistic, very direct and nonsense-free. My interest is more than piqued! I also found Shereef's restaurant patron/chef dichotomy useful. I hope I can be a chef. Shereef's talk made me realise that I may have been more on the patron side (expecting to be 'served' the learning) rather than the chef side (getting one's hands dirty). The notion of being a 'world-class beginner' at the end of the bootcamp was both inspiring and intimidating, in that it's a journey, but along a very challenging road. I love the idea of a non-competitive, yet rigorous environment. Competitiveness is absolutely counter to the way I work.</p>
          <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
          <p>In my experience having started with Karearea in 2015 and rolling back to Roa for the current intake, the environment is supportive, and really focussed on achievement and integrity.</p>
          <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
          <p>I want to learn as much as I can, and most of all, absorb the material so that it can become intuitive as quickly as possible. Coding for me ought to be like speaking, or playing an instrument (on a good day).
          I like the opportunity to develop my ability to manage time. The "depth vs. width" rabbit hole conundrum is interesting for this reason, I hope this improves my ability to "timebox".</p>
          <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
          <p>No, they've become more refined - I came to EDA with vague notions of what I thought it might be, and an idea of the framework, but very little knowledge of the content itself. This talk and my experiences in Phase-0 are just filling in the blanks at present.</p>
          <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
          <p>I'm definitely excited to see what's in store. The learning environment doesn't make me nervous - the intensity and structured nature of this sort of learning (vs peer-less self-teaching via MOOCs or freecodecamp etc) is the appeal. My challenge/fear is to do with having the necessary focus and discipline to get the most out of this course, considering how 'easy' and instantly rewarding the work I've been doing in my professional life up to this point has been.</p>
