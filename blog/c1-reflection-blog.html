      <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
      <p>I've only just read these articles, so I have little experience so far. However...</p>
      <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
      <p>All of it, really. I find meditation for one, to be very interesting. I'm concerned about my attention span - perhaps I've bought into the cultural notion that devices/the internet/insert given technology here... have ruined people's ability to focus, but in any case I want to see if meditation can improve my own. I also am interested in quieting my busy mind of unnecessary thought, so to speak, which would surely contribute to improved focus. In my other professional life, I've found intense focus to be crucial: I want to lock in with a bass player's quarter note, and contribute only the accompaniment which is necessary to support a soloist and 'fly' with them.
      In addition, the notion of confidence being displayed ability even only to onesself is pretty revelatory. Love it, and will absolutely try it. The Pomodoro technique is a simple and effective concept which I'll definitely try, despite the slightly over-marketed appearance of the system. The idea of a discrete or artificially limited unit of time set to accomplish something resonates with me. Building motivation from behaviours, and building those behaviours from habits which start very small, is another interesting strategy.</p>
      <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
      <p>See my answer to question one!</p>
      <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
      <p>All of those I mentioned in question two - meditation, confidence as ability demonstrated, introducing time constraints and habit building.</p>

    <h2>Feature Wishlist</h2>
    <p><em>Honestly - I'm trying to keep this very simple. I really like minimal websites.</em></p> 
    <ul>
      <li>A responsive background image which rescales proportionally to cover the whole width of the screen, but is short and doesn't cover a huge amount of vertical space.</li>
      <li>A centred, minimal, text-only menu above the image, with hover links.</li>
      <li>A simple column of text in the centre, below the image where relevant.</li>
    </ul></h1>h
    <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
    <p>Perhaps it's a little morbid, but HTML is essentially the bones and the flesh of a website's 'body'; it provides the content and that alone. CSS describes the way that content looks and expresses itself in web browsers, it's complexion, clothing choice, hair and eye colour, and the way the person walks. CSS shapes the page into what we see. The DOM is (in my still-forming understanding) where this analogy breaks down. Perhaps the DOM is a little like language - it is a convention which allows developers to manipulate HTML code with things like Javascript - to shape the behaviour of a person using external stimuli.</p>
    <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
    <p>Boxifying design refers to the fact that all the elements we see on a webpage are generally contained within boxes - rectangular shapes! Any exceptions to this rule (again, in my limited understanding) are either trickery, using boxes, or DOM manipulations of HTML/injections of other languages and APIs.</p>
    <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
    <p>The CSS box model is a way to manipulate the rectangular elements in HTML, using attributes like 'margin', 'border', 'padding' and 'content'. While these have specific meanings in the context of CSS, you can imagine, generally speaking, which aspects of an HTML element these will affect.</p>
