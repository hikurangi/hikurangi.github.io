            <h4> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
            <p>
              Mindfulness of one's self, is essentially the same as self-awareness. These two, interchangeable competencies can serve as a sturdy basis for sustainable self-confidence. Mindfulness of one's self, specifically a 'high-resolution' assessment of one's own strengths and weaknesses, allows an individual to know which aspects of themselves and their character they can rely on consistenly, and which weaknesses or flaws to adjust for and counteract. This gives one a complete map of their own reliability, and a solid foundation of self in which to have confidence; the ability to count on onesself in both easy and challenging circumstances, whether the circumstances play to or against one's weaknesses or not. It allows a confident person the ability to avoid any nasty surprises by revealing any skeletons in their closets before they reveal themselves at an inopportune time.
            </p>
            <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
            <p>
              Essentially, by documenting my experience with <em>Body Scan</em> and blogging about it, I am journaling: two birds. <em>Body Scan</em> was a wonderful experience. It was beneficial to me immediately, and once I become proficient with it and properly memorise and ritualise the process, I can see it being deeply beneficial to me in a permanent way. My experience with the process was as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
              In the first two to three minutes of the process, I experienced a constant barrage of intrusive thoughts. Several anxieties of greater and lesser degrees emerged, but the rest was without much serious emotional or semiotic weight: distractions, random ideas and short sentences. 'Swatting' these away in a way that Chade Meng-Tan would approve of was difficult - he advises merely acknowledging the interloping thoughts and feelings, but giving them even that minimum of respect when they arrive in such a voluminous swarm was difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following those couple of minutes, I found that I was able to clear my head almost completely and focus on my breathing and body without interruption. This was gratifying, and more so was when suddenly in the fifth minute, I felt a bloom of warmth and positivity in my mind. This made the experience of self-awareness rewarding in a new way.
            </p>
            <p>
              From here, I found alternating between reading the instructions, and following them really detracted from the beneficial aspects of the experience, but I was able to clear my head successfully, though not reconjure the positive feeling from earlier. I finished the exercise feeling focused and relaxed.
            </p>
            <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>
            <p>
              Self-control or self-mastery perhaps, in the gentler vernacular of C M-T, is the ultimate aim here. By allowing us to experience our own emotions, especially the negative ones, through mindfulness as physiological phenomena, rather than the sum total of our being and experience, we can be in charge of how we respond to them.
