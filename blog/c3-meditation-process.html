            <h4>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
            <p>
              I thought of it as something I ought to investigate more deeply. I have some practice routines which amount to meditation with very measured movement and mindfulness, but I certainly think there is value in investigating meditation as a pursuit with merits beyond my normal activities.
            </p>
            <h4>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h4>
            <p>
              I earned that mindfulness meditation trains attention and meta-attention - attention, being conscious of an occurrence or as it is described in a quote by William James, "<em>taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form</em>", and meta-attention, consciousness of one's attention paid or the absence thereof. It was also interesting to discover, in Meng's <em>Process Model of Mindfulness Meditation</em>, that an attitude of self criticism lives next to kindness and curiousity. I also think that the concept of a "grandmother mind" is a truly beautiful notion, and it's doubtlessly a great weapon in the battle against neuroses and ailing self-confidence.
            </p>
            <h4>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
            <p>
              Though this is not a technique, I really enjoyed being introduced to the notion of paying meta-attention, because I think it's a very tangible solution to the perpetual drift of my own focus.
            </p>
            <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
            <p>
              Allow me to humbly present a meditative addendum to this chapter, in the immortal words of Vulfpeck's very own Mushy (Moshe?) Krongold: (FYI this whole album is :fire:)
