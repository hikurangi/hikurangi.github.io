  "bodyHTML": "<h4>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?<\/h4><p>It has an interesting culture which I haven't been exposed to before, with its own jargon, and a very particular ethic. Holistic, very direct and nonsense-free. I also found Shereef's restaurant patron/chef dichotomy useful. I hope I can be a chef. Shereef's talk made me realise that I may have been more on the patron side (expecting to be 'served' the learning) rather than the chef side (getting one's hands dirty). The notion of being a 'world-class beginner' at the end of the bootcamp was both inspiring and intimidating, in that it's a journey, but along a very challenging road. I love the idea of a non-competitive, yet rigorous environment. Competitiveness is absolutely counter to the way I work.<\/p><h4>What are your impressions?<\/h4><p>In my experience having rolled back from a previous cohort, the environment is supportive, and really focused on achievement and integrity.<\/p><h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?<\/h4><p>I want to learn as much as I can, and most of all, absorb the material so that it can become intuitive as quickly as possible. Coding for me ought to be like speaking, or playing an instrument (on a good day). I like the opportunity to develop my ability to manage time. The \"depth vs. width\" rabbit hole conundrum is interesting for this reason, I hope this improves my ability to \"timebox\".<\/p><h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?<\/h4><p>No, they've become more refined - I came to EDA with vague notions of what I thought it might be, and an idea of the framework, but very little knowledge of the content itself. This talk and my experiences in Phase-0 are just filling in the blanks at present.<\/p><h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<\/h4><p>I'm definitely excited to see what's in store. The learning environment doesn't make me nervous - the intensity and structured nature of this sort of learning (vs peer-less self-teaching via MOOCs or freecodecamp etc) is the appeal. My challenge/fear is to do with having the necessary focus and discipline to get the most out of this course, considering how 'easy' and instantly rewarding the work I've been doing in my professional life up to this point has been.<\/p>",

  "bodyHTML": "<h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?<\/h4><p>Simplicity in my process is of the utmost importance to me, as a generally chaotic person. So I'm trying the Pomodoro technique, as it's the most tangible, easily-accessible technique on the list.<\/p><h4>What did you find interesting?<\/h4><p>Meditation also interests me. I'm concerned about my attention span - perhaps I've bought into the cultural notion that devices/the internet/insert given technology here... have ruined people's ability to focus, but in any case I want to see if meditation can improve my own. I also am interested in quieting my busy mind of unnecessary thought, so to speak, which would surely contribute to improved focus. In my other professional life, I've found intense focus to be crucial: I want to lock in with a bass player's quarter note, and contribute only the accompaniment which is necessary to support a soloist and 'fly' with them. In addition, the notion of confidence being displayed ability even only to onesself is pretty revelatory. That's what I'm here to build.<\/p><h4>What worked for you?<\/h4><p>Pomodoro seems pretty effective!<\/p><h4>Which will you experiment further with?<\/h4><p>All of those I mentioned in question two - meditation, confidence as ability demonstrated, as well as using Pomodoro and similar techniques to introduce time constraints and habit building.<\/p>",

How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?<\/h4><p>Perhaps it's a little morbid, but HTML is essentially the bones and the flesh of a website's 'body'; it provides the content and that alone. CSS describes the way that content looks and expresses itself in web browsers, it's complexion, clothing choice, hair and eye colour, and the way the person walks. CSS shapes the page into what we see. The DOM is (in my still-forming understanding) where this analogy breaks down. It's like the collected, manipulable result of HTML and CSS (and potentially other scripts) working together. It also operates a little like language would in the previous example - it llows developers to manipulate HTML code with things like Javascript - to shape the behaviour of a person using external stimuli.<\/p><h4>What is meant by boxifying design?<\/h4><p>Boxifying design refers to the fact that all the elements we see on a webpage are generally contained within boxes - rectangular shapes! Any exceptions to this rule (again, in my limited understanding) are either trickery, using boxes, or DOM manipulations of HTML/injections of other languages and APIs.<\/p><h4>What is the box model?<\/h4><p>The CSS box model is a way to manipulate the rectangular elements in HTML, using attributes like 'margin', 'border', 'padding' and 'content'. While these have specific meanings in the context of CSS, you can imagine, generally speaking, which aspects of an HTML element these will affect.<\/p>",

  "bodyHTML": "<h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?<\/h4><p>Chade-Meng Tan states that emotional intelligence allow us to create an environment in which our happiness, \"<em>a deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind...<\/em>\" (Matthieu Ricard), can exist and persist. He talks about returning to a state of happiness as the basic point of equilibrium, with resilience, optimism and kindness as its by-products (though it seems to me that optimism is also a source of happiness as a state of equilibrium).I found it interesting to note that the body often acts as an early-warning detector for emotion. Part of the process of developing emotional intelligence according to this book, is being aware of these physical indicators. I also have read before that simply naming emotions as they become present, allows us to take control of them, so reading that again here reinforces the technique's importance for me.<\/p><h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?<\/h4><p>I did the 'Easy Way' and certainly got a sense of the world slowing down, and maybe becoming a little more accessible. I look forward to trying this on a more regular basis, and experimenting with environments and silence.<\/p>",

"bodyHTML": "<h4>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?<\/h4><p>I thought of it as something I ought to investigate more deeply. I have some practice routines which amount to meditation with very measured movement and mindfulness, but I certainly think there is value in investigating meditation as a pursuit with merits beyond my normal activities.<\/p><h4>What new things have you learnt about mediation?<\/h4><p>I learned that mindfulness meditation trains attention and meta-attention - attention, being conscious of an occurrence or as it is described in a quote by William James, \"<em>taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form<\/em>\", and meta-attention, consciousness of one's attention paid or the absence thereof. It was also interesting to discover, in Meng's <em>Process Model of Mindfulness Meditation<\/em>, that an attitude of self criticism lives next to kindness and curiousity. I also think that the concept of a \"grandmother mind\" is a truly beautiful notion, and it's doubtlessly a great weapon in the battle against neuroses and ailing self-confidence.<\/p><h4>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?<\/h4><p>Though this is not a technique, I really enjoyed being introduced to the notion of paying meta-attention, because I think it's a very tangible solution to the perpetual drift of my own focus.<\/p><h4>Any other musings?<\/h4><p>Allow me to humbly present a meditative addendum to this chapter, in the immortal words of Vulfpeck's very own Mushy (Moshe?)

  "title": "Cultural Blog 5 - Self Confidence",
  "slug": "c5-self-confidence",
"bodyHTML": "<h4> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?<\/h4><p>Mindfulness of one's self, is essentially the same as self-awareness. These two, interchangeable competencies can serve as a sturdy basis for sustainable self-confidence. Mindfulness of one's self, specifically a 'high-resolution' assessment of one's own strengths and weaknesses, allows an individual to know which aspects of themselves and their character they can rely on consistenly, and which weaknesses or flaws to adjust for and counteract. This gives one a complete map of their own reliability, and a solid foundation of self in which to have confidence; the ability to count on onesself in both easy and challenging circumstances, whether the circumstances play to or against one's weaknesses or not. It allows a confident person the ability to avoid any nasty surprises by revealing any skeletons in their closets before they reveal themselves at an inopportune time.<\/p><h4>What was your experience of one of the self-awareness exercises? (Body Scan, Journaling) How did you feel?<\/h4><p>Essentially, by documenting my experience with <em>Body Scan<\/em> and blogging about it, I am journaling: two birds. <em>Body Scan<\/em> was a wonderful experience. It was beneficial to me immediately, and once I become proficient with it and properly memorise and ritualise the process, I can see it being deeply beneficial to me in a permanent way. My experience with the process was as follows:<\/p><p>In the first two to three minutes of the process, I experienced a constant barrage of intrusive thoughts. Several anxieties of greater and lesser degrees emerged, but the rest was without much serious emotional or semiotic weight: distractions, random ideas and short sentences. 'Swatting' these away in a way that Chade Meng-Tan would approve of was difficult - he advises merely acknowledging the interloping thoughts and feelings, but giving them even that minimum of respect when they arrive in such a voluminous swarm was difficult.<\/p><p>Following those couple of minutes, I found that I was able to clear my head almost completely and focus on my breathing and body without interruption. This was gratifying, and more so was when suddenly in the fifth minute, I felt a bloom of warmth and positivity in my mind. This made the experience of self-awareness rewarding in a new way.<\/p><p>From here, I found alternating between reading the instructions, and following them really detracted from the beneficial aspects of the experience, but I was able to clear my head successfully, though not reconjure the positive feeling from earlier. I finished the exercise feeling focused and relaxed.<\/p><h4>What did you take away from the \"My Emotions are Not Me\" section?<\/h4><p>Self-control or self-mastery perhaps, in the gentler vernacular of C M-T, is the ultimate aim here. By allowing us to experience our own emotions, especially the negative ones, through mindfulness as physiological phenomena, rather than the sum total of our being and experience, we can be in charge of how we respond to them.<\/p>",
